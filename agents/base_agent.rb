# BaseAgent is the parent class for all agents in this project.
# You don't need to modify this file — generate new agents with:
#
#   frai generate agent my_agent_name
#
# An agent orchestrates tasks and tools dynamically.
# Unlike pipelines, agents can make decisions and loop based on LLM responses.
#
# Example:
#   class ObjectComparisonAgent < BaseAgent
#     tool FetchDataTask
#     tool AnalyzeItemTask
#   end
#
#   ObjectComparisonAgent.call("compare object_a, object_b, object_c")
class BaseAgent < Frai::Agent
end
