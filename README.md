# project2

Built with [Frai](https://github.com/aasmolsky/frai) — Ruby LLM framework.

Ruby is an expressive language built for developer happiness — but it rarely appears in AI tooling, where Python dominates. Frai brings Rails-style conventions to LLM workflows: clear structure, sensible defaults, and a simple contract that scales from a single prompt to a multi-agent system.

The heavy lifting — LLM calls, subprocess scripts, I/O — happens outside Ruby's runtime. So you get the elegance of Ruby DSL with none of the performance concerns.

## Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "frai"
```

Then install:

```bash
bundle install
```

You'll also need a gem for your LLM provider:

```ruby
gem "anthropic"    # for Claude
gem "ruby-openai"  # for OpenAI
gem "ollama-ai"    # for Ollama (local models)
```

## Tasks

A task is the core unit — **one LLM call**. It validates input, runs scripts to gather data, renders a prompt from templates, and sends it to the LLM.

Generate a task:

```bash
frai gt analyze_item        # short for: frai generate task
```

This creates:

```
tasks/
  analyze_item/
    task.rb
    directives/
      main.md.erb
    scripts/
```

### Minimal

```ruby
class AnalyzeItemTask < BaseTask
end

AnalyzeItemTask.call("some input")
```

### With params, constants, and sub-directives

```ruby
class AnalyzeItemTask < BaseTask
  const :max_length, 500   # available in all directives as max_length

  directive :main do
    params do
      required :name,     String   # Frai::MissingParam if absent
      required :category, String   # Frai::InvalidParam if wrong type
      optional :lang,     String, default: "en"
    end

    directive :context do
      script :fetch_data do
        input   String
        returns data: String
      end
    end
  end
end
```

`task.rb` is the contract — params, constants, sub-directives, and scripts are all declared here. Types and structure live here; logic lives in the templates.

To run:

```bash
frai e AnalyzeItemTask "your input"    # short for: frai exec
```

Or from Ruby:

```ruby
AnalyzeItemTask.call(name: "item", category: "things")
```

---

## Directives

Directives are Markdown + ERB prompt templates. `main.md.erb` is always the entry point for the LLM call.

### Variables

Params, constants, and script results are available as plain methods:

```erb
<%= # tasks/analyze_item/directives/main.md.erb %>

You are an expert analyst.
Analyze this <%= category %>: <%= name %>
Respond in <%= lang %>
Max length: <%= max_length %> characters.
```

### Scripts

Run a script and capture its result:

```erb
<% script(:fetch_data).with(:name).and_return(:data) %>
<%= data %>
```

- `.with(:param)` — pass a value from the current context by name
- `.and_return(:key)` — extract `:key` from the script's JSON output and expose it as a method

Script results are memoized — each script runs at most once per task execution.

### Sub-directives

Render a sub-directive and capture its result:

```erb
<% directive(:context).with(:name).and_return(:context_text) %>
```

Output a sub-directive's rendered text:

```erb
<%= directive(:summary).with(:data) %>
```

### Conditional logic

Full Ruby is available in templates:

```erb
<% directive(:context).with(:name).and_return(:score) %>

<% if score > max_length %>
  <%= directive(:detailed).with(:score) %>
<% else %>
  <%= directive(:brief).with(:score) %>
<% end %>
```

### Shared directives

Directives reused across tasks go in the top-level `directives/` folder:

```
directives/
  base.md.erb     # available to all tasks as a fallback
```

---

## Scripts

Scripts are executables in any language. They receive `{ input: value }` as JSON on stdin and write a JSON hash to stdout.

```ruby
# tasks/analyze_item/scripts/fetch_data.rb
require 'json'
input = JSON.parse($stdin.read, symbolize_names: true)[:input]
puts JSON.generate({ data: "fetched: #{input}" })
```

```python
# tasks/analyze_item/scripts/fetch_data.py
import sys, json
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(json.dumps({ "data": f"fetched: {data['input']}" }))
```

Scripts in `scripts/` are never autoloaded — they run as subprocesses and are independently testable with pytest, jest, or any native tool.

---

## Pipelines

A pipeline chains tasks sequentially. Each task's output becomes the next task's input:

```ruby
class CompareObjectsPipeline < BasePipeline
  def call(input)
    data   = FetchDataTask.call(input)
    result = AnalyzeItemTask.call(data)
    result
  end
end

CompareObjectsPipeline.call("your input")
```

---

## Agents

An agent orchestrates tasks dynamically — it can branch, loop, and decide what to call next:

```ruby
class ResearchAgent < BaseAgent
  def call(input)
    data    = FetchDataTask.call(input)
    summary = SummarizeTask.call(data)
    summary
  end
end

ResearchAgent.call("topic to research")
```

---

## Configuration

```ruby
# config/frai.rb
Frai.configure do |config|
  config.adapter = :anthropic          # :anthropic, :openai, :ollama, :null
  config.model   = "claude-opus-4-6"
  config.api_key = ENV["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]
end
```

The `:null` adapter returns the rendered prompt without making an LLM call — useful for testing and MCP mode.

---

## MCP skill mode

Each task is automatically exposed as a Claude CLI / Codex / Cursor skill when generated:

```bash
frai gt analyze_item
# → creates task files
# → detects installed AI clients
# → registers MCP server
# → creates skill ~/.claude/skills/analyze_item/
# → disables approval prompts
```

Invoke from Claude CLI:

```
/analyze_item name(iPhone 15) category(phones)
```

Where `name` and `category` are params declared in `task.rb`. Required params missing → error.

Remove a task and clean up everything:

```bash
frai rt analyze_item       # short for: frai remove task
```
